This is a file to test some regular expressions;
the first exercise is to print file mentioning fred;
or, maybe just lines containing Fred, or Wilma;
maybe lines mentioning "Mr. Fred" should be included as well;
when a line contains the search term as part of another word,
then that line should be ignored, like with Alfred, or Frederic;
Wilma, Fred or fred should both be fine, regarding Bamm-Bamm;
By the way, do dino's like tuna or not?
